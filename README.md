# FiveM Cache Cleaner

Running this will clear the cache within your FiveM local file directory.

FiveM by default stores cache and other data on the C:\ drive whether or not your GTA V is installed on that drive. As a result, it eventually adds up to gigabytes of data being stored in this folder that is likely not being used.

This is good to run if you are taking a break from FiveM and need extra space or if you've joined multiple servers that you no longer play.


I do have a version of this for VRChat which can be found at: https://github.com/DishwasherDev/VRChat-Cache-Cleaner.git

This script is permitted for full re-distribution/modification. If you wish to give credit that's your choice.
